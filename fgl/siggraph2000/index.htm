After scoring the

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/conference/papers/index.html">SIGGRAPH

papers</a> and

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/conference/skapps/index.html">sketches</a>

authors' values, we have found Matt has blown away the competition.

His lab is worth 271 points;

second and third place winners are Peter Shirley with 212.14 points and

Michael Callahan with 198.57 points.

There were 74 competing labs, and the average number of points for a team was

86.3687258687259.

<P>

His team cost only 360 Quatloos, with enough left over to buy

an espresso machine (worth at least one extra grad student in productivity gained).

Fully half of his lab were from Stanford, which is appropriate since Stanford

dominated SIGGRAPH this year, crushing the competition like they were small

crushable things, scoring in 8 different papers. Sweet sassy molassy!



<P>

We asked Matt some questions:



<P>

<font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#0D3256">

<B>Q:</B> <I>So how did you put together the winning lab? It looks like you scouted

out the Stanford submissions, how about the rest of the team? Are you like

Kevin Bacon, some nexus of the grapevine? Or just an ordinary Joe who got

lucky?</I>



<P>

<B>A:</B> First and foremost, I'm thrilled that it wasn't necessary to go the route

of bribing the papers committee in order to take away this victory.



<P>

Certainly I made the most out of what I knew about what was coming out of

Stanford, but I'd like to think that it all really boils down to me being

so plugged into the pulse of graphics research today that my victory was

practically inevitable.  Though frankly, I wish that Don Greenberg and Andy

van Dam would stop pestering me about getting together for a golf outing so

I can fill them in on my vast and deep understanding of the landscape of

computer graphics today.



<P>

<B>Q:</B> <I>Do your relatives know yet about your accomplishment? How has this

newfound fame otherwise changed your life?</I>



<P>

<B>A:</B> Er, no.  I guess I haven't mentioned it to them.  Presumably they'll be

reading about it in the major news weeklies soon enough?



<P>

So far, the only change has been that everyone wants to know why <i>they</i>

weren't on my team.  How do you explain to your advisor, say, why he wasn't

in your winning team, since he was too expensive to draft for the potential

payoff?  How does one do this while simultaneously trying to get a thesis

outline agreed upon? 



<P>

<B>Q:</B> <I>What prize should you get for having the winning lab? Are you angry that

you're not going to get it?</I>



<P>

<B>A:</B> There really is no prize that could compare to pure joy of the victory.



<P>

That said, nothing can compare to the ribbing I can now give to Pete

Shirley and the 72 other unnamed competitors who I crushed into the ground

like tiny little insects.  Wait.  Don't publish that.  Say that I said,

"worthy competitors who gallantly gave their best" rather than that last

part.



<P>

Right, then.  So shower me with cheap ribbons and surplus drink tickets for

the papers and panels reception if you will, but it's all so fleeting in

comparison to being the winner of the first annual(?) fantasy graphics

league.



<P>

<B>Q:</B> <I>(hard hitting question, the reporter gets tough:) Do you have any regrets

that you didn't give your lab a name? Please, your tears are wasted on this

grizzled veteran.</I>



<P>

<B>A:</B> It's a great regret, actually.  Sadly, the muse of cleverness left me when

the pick a name thing came up.  Apparently I used the last of my creative

brilliance in picking the team members (bahahaahaha).



<P>

<B>Q:</B> <I>Any final comments for your fans?</I>



<P>

<B>A:</B> I'd like to thank you and your fellow schemers for putting this contest

together and for all of the work that that no doubt entailed.  I'd also

like to thank everyone on my team, especially the ones who came through for

Siggraph 2000.  I'd <i>really</i> like to thank Leif "15 point cost, 60 point

payoff" Kobbelt for coming through with his cool solo subdivision paper.



</font>

<P>

There you have it, and all we can say about winning is that it couldn't have

happened to a taller guy.

<P>

The

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/conference/papers/index.html">conference

papers</a> made up the bulk of the points for each team, with the

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/conference/skapps/index.html">sketches</a>

having only a tiny effect on them.

In fact, only four authors who could be purchased were involved in a sketch

this year (Yoshinori Dobashi, Dani Lischinski, Mel Slater, and Yizhou Yu).

83.9362934362934 of the 86.3687258687259 points an average team scored came

from papers, 2.4324324324325 points from sketches.

The main effect of points from sketches at the top of the team rankings was

to help Peter Shirley move from third to second place and David McAllister from

sixth to fourth.



<P>

<I>Late breaking controversy: the sketches on the

<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/conference/skapps/index.html">SIGGRAPH site</a>

give only the first author's name in most (but not all) cases, making it

impossible for FGL's staff of trained professionals to properly adjudicate

the results. So, for simplicity, we will award 20 points to the first author

of a sketch, nada to the (mysterious) rest of them. We reserve the right

to recompute the results if SIGGRAPH changes these pages. Odds are it won't

change a thing - with Matt far ahead, Pete surely will find it

hard to catch him (wooo, I slay me with these puns).</I>



<P>

The top ten teams were:

<PRE>

271.00 - Matt Pharr

212.14 - Peter Shirley, Sleep deprived maniacs

198.57 - Michael Callahan, Big M's House of Explicit Surfaces

180.00 - David K. McAllister, Siggraph crunchin' in my easy chair

179.57 - Peter-Pike Sloan, Graphics 'R Us

165.71 - Doug Zongker, bleah.com, inc.

165.00 - Tomas M&ouml;ller

163.00 - Wolfgang Heidrich, VIsualization And GRAphics

152.00 - Sebastien Paquet, Bitum

150.57 - Gary Yngve, GVU

149.00 - Hanspeter Pfister, Why Two Kegs?

148.57 - G. W., GSTB

147.57 - David Johnson

142.00 - Davis King, GVU squared

139.00 - YON - Jan C. Hardenbergh, Ray Benders

</PRE>



The observant reader will note that there are fifteen top ten teams.

This is because a few authors' names did not properly get matched between

datasets when the results were first tabulated, e.g.  it wasn't noted that

"B. Mirtich" and "Brian Mirtich" were the same person.

Brian was a particularly significant pick, chosen by 6 teams, at a cost of

only 5 Quatloos and yielding 60 points.

So, taking a page from college football, in which the

<a href="http://espn.go.com/ncaa/clubhouses/ncf_index.html">Big Ten</a> is

actually made of 11 teams, we list the original top ten interspersed with

the five newcomers.



<P>

Teams were of all different sorts: alumni teams (witness GVU's success), name

teams (all Marks, all Erics [plus a John Hughes for pinch hitting]),

theme teams (all ex-ray tracing researchers),

location teams (Brussels), and power hitters (teams of just Salesin/Debevec and Hoppe/Debevec).

That said, it appears that most teams were created to be serious contenders.

There was a tie for the most popular author to be chosen for a team: Peter

Shirley and Wolfgang Heidrich were each chosen by 14 teams.



<P>

With the inclusion of Brian "Mr. Efficiency" Mirtich,

the best team that can be formed is now worth 538 points and costs 390 quatloos

(it's somewhat surprising that 10 quatloos are unspent):

<PRE>

### value  cost  val/cst  Name

</PRE>



and Matt Pharr is now in trouble, since his advisor is on this team.



<P>

That's about it, and thanks for participating.

What follows are a bunch of tables of data, both the raw

input data and the results sorted by various factors.



<P>

Input data files: the 5 year <a href="previous_authors.txt">SIGGRAPH author listing file</a>,

the <a href="sigpaper.txt">SIGGRAPH 2000 paper listing</a>, and the

<a href="sigsketch.txt">SIGGRAPH 2000 sketch listing</a>.



<P>

Author values: listed <a href="authors_alpha.txt">alphabetically</a>,

by <a href="authors_points.txt">highest point value earned</a> (Salesin,

Hanrahan, and Levoy were the three authors to score more than 60 points), and

by <a href="authors_eff.txt">efficiency</a>

(i.e. the author's point value is divided by quatloo cost).

The best possible team is mostly made of the most efficient authors (who are now

inefficient for next year, since they will now cost more quatloos), though

there are a few pricier authors in the mix.

not just rate the authors, visit <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~tor/sig2000.html">Tim Rowley's site</a>.
