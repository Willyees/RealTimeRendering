They have also done some work on handling curved surfaces, a trickier case. See <a href="http://fabio.policarpo.nom.br/relief/index.htm">Policarpo's site</a> for more demos and papers.

<p>Color bleeding takes on a whole new meaning when a classic radiosity test-case is used as a <a href="http://www.sync.dk/~khn/stuff/">game environment</a>.
<p>A new way of simulating radiosity effects that is rapidly becoming popular is the class of "ambient occlusion" or "obscurance" techniques. We mention this idea briefly on p. 284-5 of the 2nd edition. The basic idea is to examine the nearby geometry for a given point on a surface and precompute approximately how much this geometry will affect how much ambient light reaches this point. <a href="http://ima.udg.es/iiia/GGG/UsersDocs/mateu/obscurances.pdf">Iones et al.</a> gives one method of performing this type of computation, <a href="http://www.rhythm.com/~ivan/visMaps.html">Neulander</a> another. ATI's free <a href="http://www.ati.com/developer/tools.html">normal mapper</a> now supports generation of ambient occlusion. This technique is also used for <a href="http://www-viz.tamu.edu/students/bmoyer/617/ambocc/">non-interactive rendering</a> (more information <a href="http://www.andrew-whitehurst.net/amb_occlude.html">here</a> and <a href="http://zj.deathfall.com/depthbasedOcc.htm">here</a>).
<p> <font color="#a043a0">Sub-surface scattering is a phenomena where photons are enter into some medium (e.g., skin or marble), bounces
around inside the media, and then exits at some point other than the entry point. For real-time rendering, many proposals to handle
this effect have been suggested, including <a href="http://www9.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Persons/Stamminger/Research/Research/tsm"> translucent shadow maps</a>, <a href="http://lumumba.luc.ac.be/~tommertens/itrans/index.html"> Merten et al's technique</a>, and
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/gvil/projects/translucency.shtml">Hao et al's technique</a>.
</font>
<p> <font color="#a043a0">To create depth of field, one can render the scene, build a mipmap, and then sample the
mipmap hierarchy according to the distance the pixel's depth from some focal plane. The closer to the focal plane, the less blur.
Such techniques have been described by <a href="http://ducati.doc.ntu.ac.uk/uksim/dad/webpagepapers/Game-18.pdf">Cant et al.</a> and
by <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/8230/GDC2003_Demos.pdf">Demers, in the "Ogres and Fairies"</a> presentation from GDC2003.

For some speculation on what the next generation of graphics hardware holds,
see <a href="http://tech-report.com/etc/2002q3/nextgen-gpus/index.x?pg=4">Scott
Wasson's</a> article. I disagree with his belief that Pixar-level quality is just
around the corner - we need more memory for textures and geometry (say a gigabyte
for each - doable in a few years), and much more sampling and filtering per pixel
(which will suck up a lot of compute power) to achieve this goal. It's still a
good overview of the current state of the art, and discusses a fair bit about
the GeForce FX (then NV30) vs. ATI's R300 (i.e. the Radeon 9700).
<p><font color="#c850c8">NVIDIA has gone one step beyond madness for the &uuml;bergamer: <a href="http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=195">Quad SLI</a>, in which four high-end graphics chips work on the same frame at once. 2 GB on-board memory, 96 pixel pipelines, 5.2 teraflops, and 6-speed F1-derived gearbox (wait, that last one's for the F430 Ferrari).</font>
<p>There are a number of papers at <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~tor/sig2003.html">SIGGRAPH 2003</a>
 about using the GPU for implementing classical numerical algorithms, such as sparse matrix solvers.
 Mark Harris has made an extensive research and resources site about <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/">using
  GPUs to rapidly solve non-graphical problems</a>. <font color="#c850c8">Their wikified <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org/wiki/FAQ">FAQ</a> is particularly helpful.</font> Also see <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/hardware/index.shtml">UNC Chapel Hill's page.
<font color="#c850c8">One of the first commercial products using the GPU for something other than 3D rendering is ATI's
<a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1880668,00.asp">Avivo product</a>. Admittedly, this product
doesn't wander far from the GPU's original purpose, converting video files to other formats, about five times faster than the CPU can do this operation.</font>

  from the <a href="http://www.3dlinks.com/">3D Links site</a>), and David Duberman's
  <a href="http://www.3dlinks.com/spectrum/index.cfm">Spectrum Report</a>. Both
  are worthwhile, and both are free. <a href="http://www.cgw.com">Computer
  Graphics World</a> tracks commercial developments in the computer graphics industry
  in general, though it's easier to just read the magazine.

<p><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/jobsearch">Gamasutra</a> lists a number
  games industry employment opportunities.
  <a href="http://www.games-match.com/">games-match.com</a> tries to match up

<h3>FAQs and Related Sites</h3>
</a>
<p>The home for the most current graphics FAQs is the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/">Internet
  FAQ Archives</a>.
<p> There are a number of online glossaries of terms. Apple has a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/Sprockets/GameSprockets-317.html">Mac
  oriented one</a>, and <a href="http://webopedia.internet.com/Graphics/">Webopedia</a>
  a short general one. Schorsch has a <a href="http://www.schorsch.com/kbase/glossary/index.html">glossary
  of lighting design terms</a> available online.
<p> Usenet news has 2% pure gold, information you cannot find anywhere else. The
  newsgroup <a href="news:comp.graphics.algorithms">comp.graphics.algorithms</a>
  is just what it sounds like, and often has interesting threads. <a href="http://stevehollasch.com/cgindex/index.html">Much
  of the gold</a> has been collected in one spot by Steve Hollasch. The newsgroups
  <a href="news:comp.games.development.programming.algorithms">comp.games.development.programming.algorithms</a>
  and <a href="news:comp.games.development.programming.misc">comp.games.development.programming.misc</a>
  have good material about real-time programming. If you have a specific topic
  in mind, <a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a> is a good way
  to search Usenet news for it.

<h3>OpenGL</h3>
</a>
<p>The best source for OpenGL information is <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL.org</a>.
  <font color="#c850c8">The latest <a href="http://www.opengl.org/documentation/opengl_current_version.html">OpenGL specification</a> lives there, among much else.</font>
  A handy resource is all the <a href="http://developer.3dlabs.com/documents/index.htm">OpenGL
  reference documentation</a> online and hyperlinked (there are a number of variants
  on this, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/opengl/glfunc02_5ub8.asp">Microsoft's</a>;
  search <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> on &quot;glGet&quot; for
  more). The 1.1 (i.e. pretty ancient) version of the entire <a href="http://acm.up.edu/redbook/">Red
  Book</a> is available online.
<p>A good way to learn OpenGL is to use it; <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~nate/tutors.html">Nate
  Robins's tutorials</a> are an excellent starting place. Another good set of OpenGL tutorials
  can be found on <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">Neon Helium's site</a>. There's also a short
  <a href="http://www.nullterminator.net/opengl32.html">OpenGL Win32 tutorial</a>.
  Tom Nuydens has many
  <a href="http://www.delphi3d.net/listfiles.php?category=2">code examples</a>
  of OpenGL functionality done in Delphi.
<p><a href="http://www.delphi3d.net/hardware/index.php">The OpenGL Hardware Registry</a>
  lists the OpenGL capabilities for many different graphics cards. There are also a
  <a href="http://www.delphi3d.net/download.php">large number of demos</a> available,
  showing the use of many different API calls.
  A list of all <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/">OpenGL
  extensions</a> is maintained at SGI's site. The <a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net">GLEW library</a> is an open source project which helps with the use of OpenGL extensions. NVIDIA's extensions and a huge amount
  of other <a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=opengl">OpenGL related
  information</a> is available at their site
<p>Mark Kilgard's <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glut_downloads.html">GLUT
  (GL Utilities Toolkit)</a> is another good way to try out and experiment with
  code for many advanced features in OpenGL, and provides a basic platform independent
  windowing API for OpenGL. There is a <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/glut_faq.html">FAQ</a> about GLUT.
  A newer version of GLUT is on SourceForge, called
  <a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/">freeglut</a>.
  <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/glui/">GLUI</a>
  is an interface library built on top of GLUT, for making user interface buttons,
  checkboxes, arcballs, etc. The <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">Fast Light Toolkit</a>
  is a GUI toolkit that has GLUT emulation.
<p>
For testing the speed of an OpenGL feature, try the <a href="http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/isfast.html">isfast
  and pdb</a> packages.
<p>The
  author of the <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1571691642?tag=somebooksilike">OpenGL
  Superbible</a></I> <a href="http://starstonesoftware.com/OpenGL/">has a website</a>
  with some tidbits on it.
<p>Opengl.org hosts a number of useful <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/">OpenGL
  FAQs</a>. SGI also has an <a href="http://www.sgi.com/software/opengl/faq.html">OpenGL
  FAQ</a> which is of more general interest, talking about the ARB and other non-technical matters. Inactive OpenGL FAQs, but still possibly of interest: the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/5625/opengl/">EFnet
  FAQ</a>, and the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/opengl-faq/part1/">extremely
  ancient newsgroup FAQ</a>.
<p>To see what makes OpenGL tick, take a look at <a href="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/">Mesa</a>
  or <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/">SGI's sample implementation</a>.
  SGI's reference implementation is not meant to be fast, but is useful for understanding
  what various commands do. SGI's old but fast software <a href="http://www.berkelium.com/OpenGL/sgi-opengl.html">OpenGL
  for Windows</a> is available for download. Mesa's is more practical, and the
  (poorly named) <a href="http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net/">Utah-GLX project</a>
  is actively working on drivers for Mesa.</p>
<p>OpenGL continues to evolve, with a <a href="http://developer.3dlabs.com/openGL2/index.htm">2.0
  specification</a>.</p>
<p>SGI's publicly available <a href="http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/">technical
  publications</a> are a useful collection of tutorials and articles. This library
  includes <a href="http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/dynaweb_bin/0640/bin/nph-dynaweb.cgi/dynaweb/SGI_Developer/OpenGLonSGI/@Generic__BookView"><i>OpenGL
  on Silicon Graphics Systems</i></a>, which has chapters on optimization.
<p>The OpenGL newsgroup is <a href="news:comp.graphics.api.opengl">comp.graphics.api.opengl</a>.
  SGI-specific OpenGL questions can be posted to <a href="news:comp.sys.sgi.graphics">comp.sys.sgi.graphics</a>.
  An <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opengl-gamedev-l/">active mailing
  list for OpenGL game developers</a> is open to all.
<p><font color="#7a357a">OpenGL can be called from a number of languages other than C, such as Java via <a href="http://gl4java.sourceforge.net/">GL4Java</a>, Perl via <a href="http://graphcomp.com/pogl.cgi?v=0111s1m1">POGL</a> or <a href="http://linux.maruhn.com/sec/perl-opengl.html">CPAN's Perl-OpenGL</a>, Python via <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>.
  The best place for OS support and language binding information is on the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/documentation/implementations.html">OpenGL site</a>.</font>
  In addition, Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/">Java3D</a> also
  calls OpenGL or Direct3D, but is more a scene graph and world building interface
  than a renderer.
<p>Hybrid has released their <a href="http://www.hybrid.fi/main/download/tools.php">implementations of OpenGL ES 1.0 and 1.1</a> for free evaluation and noncommercial use. They also host a <a href="http://forum.hybrid.fi/">forum for mobile graphics</a>.
<p>Subsets of OpenGL have been written for the Palm: <a href="http://www.dsbox.com/minigl.html">miniGL</a>
  and <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/TinyGL/">tinyGL</a>.
  In related
  news, Microsoft announced it is adding <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/newswire/bit_blasts/20000302/index3.htm">DirectX
  capabilities to Windows CE</a>. Microwindows is an open source project to bring
  MS Windows' API to smaller devices.
<p>Mason Woo has an <a href="http://www.woo.com/errata.html">errata site</a> for
  the <i>OpenGL Programming Guide</i>. <a href="ftp://ftp.sgi.com/opengl/">Code
  examples from this book</a> and other OpenGL related documents and executables
  are also available. <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/opengl/">Druid's GL Journal</a>
  has a number of interesting articles and links for OpenGL. A tutorial on <a href="http://gamasutra.com/features/19990723/opengl_texture_objects_01.htm">OpenGL
  texture objects</a> is available from Gamasutra's site.
<p> <a href="http://glean.sourceforge.net/">Glean</a> is a free OpenGL conformance
  test suite. <a href="http://www.glsetup.com/">GLSetup</a> detects the graphics
  card and installs the matching OpenGL drivers (though this site hasn't been
  updated for almost a year, so...). <a href="http://glean.sourceforge.net/"></a>
<p>A large number of IHVs has announced the formation of the <a href="http://www.khronos.org/">Khronos
  Group SIG</a> to develop <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/newswire/bit_blasts/20000414/index4.htm">OpenML</a>,
  an API for integrating OpenGL graphics with video and audio.
<p><a href="http://www.xglspec.org/">XGL</a> is meant for representing scenes by using an XML format that
  maps easily to OpenGL calls.
<p><font color="#c850c8">For porting to the Mac, <a href="http://www.macdx.com/">MacDx</a> takes your DirectX
  calls and converts them to OpenGL</font>.
<p>To convert OpenGL calls into vector-based Postscript, use <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/">GL2PS</a>.
<p>Here's a resource guide for <a href="http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/henryj/links/">OpenGL

  developers' mailing list</a> for the Mac.
<p>Available on the web is <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~legalize/d3d-vs-opengl.html">a
  succinct summary</a> of Direct3D and OpenGL and the differences between the
  two. For a brief (and biased) history of OpenGL and the API wars, see <a href="http://www.vcnet.com/bms/features/3d.html"><i>Microsoft
