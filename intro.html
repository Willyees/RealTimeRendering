What follows is a brief overview of the chapters ahead.




<p><b>Chapter 2, The Graphics Rendering Pipeline.</b> This chapter

deals with the heart of real-time rendering, the mechanism that

takes a scene description and converts it into something we can

see.




<p><b>Chapter 3, Transforms.</b> The basic tools to manipulate

position, scaling, orientation, etc, of objects and the viewer

are transforms.




<p><b>Chapter 4, Visual Appearance.</b> This chapter covers the definition of

materials and lights and their use in achieving a realistic surface appearance.

Also covered are other appearance-related topics,

such as providing higher image quality through antialiasing and

gamma correction.




<p><b>Chapter 5, Texturing.</b> One of the most powerful hardware-accelerated

tools for real-time rendering is the ability to

display data such as images on surfaces. This chapter discusses

the mechanics of this technique, called texturing, and presents a

wide variety of methods for applying it.




<p><b>Chapter 6, Special Effects.</b> There is more to rendering

than creating surfaces, materials, and textures. This chapter

presents techniques and tricks beyond the basics.




<p><b>Chapter 7, Speed-Up Techniques.</b> After you make it go,

make it go fast. Various forms of culling, model representation,

and geometry consolidation are covered here.




<p><b>Chapter 8, Pipeline Optimization.</b> Once an application is

running and uses efficient algorithms, it can be made even faster

using various optimization techniques. Finding the bottleneck and

deciding what to do about it are the topics covered here.




<p><b>Chapter 9, Polygonal Techniques.</b> Geometric data comes

from a wide range of sources, and sometimes requires modification

in order to be

rendered rapidly and well. This chapter discusses polygonal data

and ways to clean it up and simplify it.




<p><b>Chapter 10, Intersection Test Methods.</b> Intersection

testing is important for rendering, user interaction, and

collision detection. In-depth coverage is provided here for a wide

range of the most efficient algorithms for common geometric

intersection tests.




<p><b>Chapter 11, Collision Detection.</b> Finding out whether two

objects touch each other is a key element of many real-time

applications. This chapter presents some efficient algorithms in

this rapidly evolving field.




<p><b>Chapter 12, Graphics Hardware.</b> While

graphics-hardware-accelerated algorithms have been discussed in the previous

chapters, this chapter focuses on components such as color depth,

frame buffers, and basic architecture types. Case studies of a few

representative graphics accelerators are provided.




<p><b>Chapter 13, The Future.</b> Take a guess (we do).




<p>We have included appendices on linear algebra and trigonometry.
