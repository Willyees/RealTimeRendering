<hr>

The title <I>Real-Time Rendering</I> pretty much sums it up. This

book is about algorithms which create synthetic images fast enough

that the viewer can interact with a virtual environment. We have

focused on three dimensional rendering and, to a limited extent, user

interaction. Modeling, animation, and many other areas are

important to the process of making a real-time application, but

are beyond the scope of this book.




<p>

This field is rapidly evolving and so is a moving target. Graphics

accelerators for the consumer market are currently doubling in speed every

six months. Graphics libraries appear, evolve, and often die out.

For these reasons we have avoided describing specific APIs,

chipsets, buses, memory architectures, etc., except where it

serves the goal of informing you, the reader, about some general

concept. We have endeavored to describe algorithms that, by their

popularity or lasting value, are likely to be used for some time to

come.




<p>

We expect you to have some basic understanding of computer

graphics before reading this book. The equivalent of a semester

course in graphics should be sufficient, though we cannot

guarantee we will not sometimes lose you along the way. Some of the later

chapters in particular are meant for implementors of various

complex algorithms. If some text does pass you by, skim on

through. One of the most valuable services we feel we can provide is

to at least

let you realize what you do not yet know, and so know where to look for it later.




<p>

This book does not exist in a vacuum; we make a point of

referencing relevant material wherever possible, as well as

providing a summary of further reading and resources at the end of

most chapters. We also spent much time searching for reference

locations on the Web; many current papers are available there for

free. The days are coming to an end when only those living near a good research library

could learn about various algorithms.




<p>

Because Web resources are notoriously transient and because the

field is evolving so rapidly, we maintain a Web site related to

this book. At <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com">http://www.realtimerendering.com</a>,

the site contains links to tutorials,

demonstration programs, code samples, software libraries, and much

more.




<p>


Our true goal and guiding light while writing this book was

simple. We wanted to write a book that we wished we had owned when

we had started out, a book that was both unified and crammed with

details not found in introductory texts. We hope that you will find

this book, our view of the world, of some use in your travels.

Many other people contributed their time and labor to this

project. Some let us use images, others provided models, still

others pointed out important resources or connected us with people

who could help. In addition to the people listed above, we wish to acknowledge the help of Tony
