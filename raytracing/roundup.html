Description: The Surfacing Artist has always been confronted with adapting texture to their 3D content. While Painter has revolutionized 3D painting, getting all the different textures prepared and "baked" for their asset is still a necessary step before and after getting to the actual painting phase. With RTX and hardware accelerated ray tracing now integrated in Painter, times for baking are dramatically reduced, allowing to quickly iterate between modeling and painting phases, much more design iterations and leaving room for actual artistic creativity instead of waiting for long compute times. Nikie will share her first experience with RTX baking in Substance Painter on actual assets and how it impacts her creative workflow.

<B>Thursday 10am - 10:30am, NVIDIA booth #1313,</b> Booth Talk: <B>Adding RTX acceleration to Iray with OptiX</B>, presenter: Lutz Kettner, NVIDIA
<BR>
Description: Used in Siemens NX, Dassault Systèmes Catia and Solidworks, along with other leading product design packages, the Iray rendering engine and MDL (Material Definition Language) deliver predictable, simulation-quality photorealistic imagery with full artistic freedom. In this talk we will present our approach to enable NVIDIA RTX technology and RT Cores within Iray. We will present architectural decisions made to leverage the latest version of OptiX and explain what affects performance in practice.

<B>Thursday 11:30am - noon, NVIDIA booth #1313,</b> Booth Talk: <B>RTX, a breakthrough in VFX and animation workflow</B>, presenter: Jean-Colas Prunier, PocketStudio
<BR>
Description: PocketStudio is a next generation collaborative edition tool to create 3D animated feature film. This talk will present how this tool revealed at Siggraph 2018 and now in beta, heavily relies on NVIDIA RTX technology to bring real-time GPU ray tracing in an easy-to-use interface for professionals, detailing how existing studios in deployment leverages it in their workflow. Entirely built from the ground up for film artists, it would not serve its purpose of lightspeed professional grade rendering without hardware ray tracing made available in NVIDIA Turing boards.

<B>Thursday noon - 12:30pm, NVIDIA booth #1313,</b> Booth Talk: <B>The Diminishing Need For Offline Rendering: Building Real Time Projects for Both Design and Marketing with RTX</B>, presenter: Stephen Phillips, Theia
<BR>
Description: The quality gap between real time and offline rendering is narrowing thanks to RTX technology. Modern workflows can allow both VR design review sessions and final marketing renders to come from the same source files without an extra team of artists and redundant software licenses. In this Unreal Engine project breakdown with Theia Interactive, you'll get advanced tips and tricks for planning and executing this efficient new method of delivering the highest quality work for every customer need.

<B>Thursday 3:45pm - 5:15pm, Room 153,</b> SIGGRAPH Course: <b><a href="https://s2019.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_376&sess=sess452">RTX Accelerated Ray Tracing With OptiX</a></b>
<BR>
Description:
This course is aimed at programmers interested in using OptiX to write RTX accelerated ray tracing applications. It will start with the general concepts behind the OptiX API, and then build up to more advanced topics such as how to properly use, and optimize for, the hardware ray tracing cores of modern GPUs.
