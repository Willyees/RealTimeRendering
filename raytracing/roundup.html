<BR>
Description: The Surfacing Artist has always been confronted with adapting texture to their 3D content. While Painter has revolutionized 3D painting, getting all the different textures prepared and "baked" for their asset is still a necessary step before and after getting to the actual painting phase. With RTX and hardware accelerated ray tracing now integrated in Painter, times for baking are dramatically reduced, allowing to quickly iterate between modeling and painting phases, many more design iterations and leaving room for actual artistic creativity instead of waiting for long compute times. Nikie will share her first experience with RTX baking in Substance Painter on actual assets and how it impacts her creative workflow.

Description:
We describe a fast, scalable technique for ray tracing photorealistic global illumination. It upgrades standard static light probes to both fix light leaks and accelerate them for dynamic run-time ray tracing on any recent GPU. This streamlines art workflow, increases visual fidelity, and lifts lighting restrictions on gameplay. We describe this probe technique along with new implementation details that give a 2x performance increase and heightened image quality over previous versions. We also show how to accelerate ray traced reflections and full GPU path tracing using the same probe data structure, and discuss the road map for this technology.

<BR>
Description:
The NVIDIA Research and Developer Technology teams will present the latest developments and techniques for ray tracing and their application to real-time rendering for games, simulation, and VR applications.
<UL>
<LI>Light at the End of the Ray, Alexey Panleteev (NVIDIA)
<UL>
<LI>We’ll talk about importance sampling and why it is critical for real-time ray tracing applications. Tracing rays towards light sources dramatically reduces noise compared to uniform random sampling, but discovering the light sources may be a non-trivial task. We’ll discuss the direct light system used in Quake II RTX and potential solutions that may be suitable for other games.
</UL>

<LI>Ray-Traced Global Illumination for Games: Massively Parallel Path Space Filtering, Alex Keller (NVIDIA)
<UL>
<LI>Restricting path tracing to a small number of paths per pixel for performance reasons rarely achieves a satisfactory image quality. Using a hash map, we greatly improve the performance of path space filtering, yielding a dramatically better visual quality at interactive frame rates.
</UL>

<LI>Ray Tracing at 240 Hz., Josef Spjut (NVIDIA)
<UL>
<LI>We present one technique to combine real time ray tracing with newly available 240 Hz refresh rate monitors so that the computer can collaborate with the human visual system to integrate high quality images and video in the brain. We use a combination of frameless and interleaved rendering concepts together with ideas from temporal antialiasing algorithms to trade spatial resolution for higher refresh rate and reduced spatiotemporal aliasing.
