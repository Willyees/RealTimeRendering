<h1>Call for Participation: <i>Ray Tracing Gems II</i></h1>

<p>Real-time ray tracing - the holy grail of rendering - is now possible. Thanks to advances
in GPU hardware and API standards like Microsoft's DirectX Raytracing (DXR)
and Vulkan Ray Tracing (VKR), the next step forward in
real-time image quality and content creation is not only possible, but being
rapidly adopted by developers.</p>

<p>Following the success of the <i>Ray Tracing Gems</i> book (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracinggems/">updated free PDF</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Gems-High-Quality-Real-Time/dp/1484244265/">physical book</a>), NVIDIA is working with leading graphics developers and researchers to follow up with a
second book, to be titled <i>Ray Tracing Gems II</i>. To be published by the Game Developers
Conference (GDC) in March 2021, the book will focus primarily on real-time
and interactive GPU ray tracing, but also includes valuable information useful
in any ray tracing setting.</p>

<p>We invite articles on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic ray tracing algorithms (intersection testing, spatial data structures, etc.)</li>
<li>Unified lighting schemes
<li>Shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, etc.</li>
<li>Reconstruction, denoising, and filtering</li>
<li>Rasterization and ray tracing hybrids</li>
<li>Particles, volumetrics, and hair</li>
<li>Level of detail (geometric, material, and texture)</li>
<li>Animation schemes</li>
<li>Global Illumination</li>
<li>Occlusion Culling</li>
<li>Materials and BRDFs</li>
<li>Efficiency and best practices</li>
<li>Non-graphics applications (audio, collision, physics, etc.)</li>
<li>Virtual Reality (VR/AR/XR/MR)</li>
<li>Deep learning</li>
<li>...and any other notable work related to ray tracing</li>
</ul>

<p>Articles will be primarily judged on practical utility. Though long articles with novel results are welcome, short practical articles with battle-tested techniques are highly encouraged.</p>

<h2>Sign me up. What's the process?</h2>

<p>Write a short abstract that describes your article and email it to <a href="mailto:raytracinggems@nvidia.com">raytracinggems@nvidia.com</a>. Anyone can submit an article abstract for consideration, and submissions are open starting today.</p>

<p><i>Ray Tracing Gems II</i> will be jointly edited by Adam Marrs, Pete Shirley, and Ingo Wald. The editors will review your abstract submission, provide feedback, and either conditionally accept or reject your article proposal. After receiving conditional acceptance of your article abstract from the editors, you may submit your completed article anytime until <b>Tuesday September 1st, 2020</b>. Submitted articles are not guaranteed to be accepted, and may be rejected based on quality.</p>

<p>Accepted articles will be assigned to section editors for feedback and polishing. We encourage authors to submit their articles as soon as possible to benefit from the input they'll receive from their section editor. After receiving the required edits from your section editor, the final revised article will be due by <b>Tuesday December 1st, 2020</b>.</p>

<p>If you have questions about your article idea, the abstract review process, or the book you can email <a target="_blank" href="mailto:raytracinggems@nvidia.com">raytracinggems@nvidia.com</a> or reach out to the editors <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/acmarrs">@acmarrs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Peter_shirley">@Peter_shirley</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/IngoWald">@IngoWald</a> on Twitter.</p>
